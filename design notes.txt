*TEST*

	- use physics for camera movements
		-figure out what's fun
		-add stabilize and slowdown functions
		does there need to be vertical movement in addition to side to side strafing

*IMPLEMENT*

	- error handling on mesh/texture/shader loading
	- irrklang audio scenenode
	- state manager
	- input engine
	- physics
	- camera controller class
	- bump mapping (requires calculating tangent vectors)




enhance lighting effects to include multiple light sources
tie physics into the entity system to include automatic set up of objects
